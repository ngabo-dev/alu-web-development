Let's Build a Webpage!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the beginning of an exciting journey where we'll be creating a webpage from scratch, straight out of a designer file. Now, for this first project, we're putting on our HTML hats - no CSS, no styling, just pure HTML magic!

Project Overview

So, what's the plan? We're diving into the HTML structure, focusing on making it solid and semantic. And yeah, no worries about making things look pretty for now - that's a mission for another day.

Objectives

Let's break down what we're aiming for:

HTML Structure: We're building the bones of our webpage. Think of it as setting up the foundation for a house, but in the virtual world.

Semantics: We want our HTML to make sense. That's where semantic HTML elements come into play. They give meaning to our content, making it more understandable.

Image Integration: We're jazzing things up a bit by adding an image. I'll guide you on where to pop that image in our HTML structure.
